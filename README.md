# Sepsis Evaluation pieline



## 1. Dataset creation 

-> Usage of R scripts from Gibbs et al.





## 2. Database Import and Evaluation

-> Database benchmarking across SQLite, Neo4j, PostgreSQL and MySQL



## 3. Most accurate predictions with GNNs

-> Edges are all you Need to handle variable-length time-series 

-> Check how good I can get with Interprtatbility



## 4. GraphAware Evaluation

-> Custom trained models

-> Analyze with SHAP



##5. SBC-SHAP use pretrained models and web aplication to get results

-> Just pass CSV as Input and check results if not good enough add new MIMC trained models in web app?
